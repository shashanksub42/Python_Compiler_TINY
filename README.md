# Python_Compiler_TINY

This is an effort to learn more about compilers by creating one. I was watching a Primeagen video where he is reviewing a blog post which highlights some challenging software engineering projects. One of the projects was to build a compiler. I dived deeper into [this link](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html) where Austin Henley has done such an amazing job of building a very simple compiler using Python. This is a link to his [GitHub repo](https://github.com/AZHenley/teenytinycompiler). 

I have currently finished part 1, which involves creating the Lexer.
